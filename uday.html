        <p><b>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an expansive and interconnected film and television franchise produced by Marvel Studios. Launched in 2008 with Iron Man, it has grown into one of the most successful film franchises in history, encompassing numerous films, TV shows, and spin-offs. The MCU is divided into several phases, each building upon the last to develop a larger overarching storyline, most notably focusing on the Infinity Saga (Phases 1-3), where heroes like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Avengers team up to battle powerful villains like Thanos. The culmination of this saga occurred with Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), which were global box office successes and solidified the MCU's cultural impact. Following the Infinity Saga, the MCU has ventured into the Multiverse Saga, introducing new characters like Shang-Chi, the Eternals, and reimagining familiar ones, while expanding its stories through Disney+ series like WandaVision and Loki. The MCU is praised for its rich storytelling, strong character development, and groundbreaking interconnected narrative, creating a universe that spans multiple media formats and continues to grow with each new release.</b></p>

    <p><b>Thor, the God of Thunder, is one of the most iconic heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and is based on the Norse mythological figure. Played by Chris Hemsworth, Thor made his debut in Thor (2011) as the powerful yet arrogant prince of Asgard, who is cast down to Earth by his father, Odin, to learn humility. Throughout his journey, Thor evolves from a brash warrior to a noble and wise leader.

        In the MCU, Thor wields the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, which grants him control over lightning and the ability to fly. Over the course of his solo films and appearances in the Avengers franchise, Thor has faced numerous challenges, including the trickery of his brother Loki, the destruction of Asgard, and the immense threat of Thanos, who sought to wipe out half of all life in the universe. Thor’s personal growth is marked by loss and redemption, as he navigates the responsibilities of being a god, a king, and an Avenger.
        
        In Thor: Ragnarok (2017), his character undergoes a transformation, both in power and personality, as he embraces his role as the protector of Asgard’s people, leading them after the fall of their homeland. His humor, strength, and enduring resilience make him a fan-favorite, and his journey continues as he explores his place in the universe beyond the realms of Asgard, alongside fellow heroes like the Guardians of the Galaxy</b></p>
